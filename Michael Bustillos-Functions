/* Exercise 1: Function Practice
In this exercise, you will be creating functions for different scenarios.
Don't worry about invalid input being passed in. */

/*ADDED PARENTHESES AFTER LET STATEMENTS FOR FUNCTIONS AND ADDED PARENTHESES ON LOG STATEMENT AT BOTTOM*/

/* Function 1: Feet to Kilometer Converter
Create a function that takes in feet, and converts it to kilometers. Return the result. */

let ft2km = function ( feet ) {

/* Function 2: Tip Calculator
Create a function that takes in the amount that the meal cost, and a tip given as a decimal.
Have the default value of the tip be 0.15. Return the amount that should be tipped. */

/* Function 3: Should I wear a jacket?
Create a function that takes in the temperature (Assume Farenheit) and a bool if it is raining.
Set the default for the bool to be false.
Print to the console "You should wear a jacket" for the following scenarios:
The temperature is less than 40.
The temperature is between 40-80 inclusive and it is raining.
All other scenarios print "You do not need to wear a jacket" */f
