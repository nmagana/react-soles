/* Exercise 2: Objects Practice
In this exercise, you will be practicing creating objects, object methods. */

/* Object 1: Vending Machine Object
Properties:
Capacity -> have it start to be 100
Stock -> have it start to be 50
Methods:
  addStock -> takes in the amount to stock, stocks if it doesn't go over capacity. Print to console if not possible.
  getItem -> removes one item from the vending machine. Print to console if stock is 0. */
  
  /*ADDED "this." TO STOCK IN VENDING MACHINE, REMOVED RETURN STATEMENT. ADDED "};" AT END OF OBJECT AND LET STATEMENT FOR ROBOT*/
  
 let vendingMachine = {
    capacity: 100;
    stock: 50;
    addStock: function ( store ) {
        if ( store + this.stock > this.capacity ){
            console.log("Not possible");}
        else{
            this.stock = this.stock + store;}
    }
    getItem: function() {
        if (stock > 0){
            this.stock = this.stock - 1;}
        else{
            console.log("Empty");}
    }
};

/* Object 2: Design your own Object!
Criteria: Two Properties and Two Methods, have fun! */

let robot = {
    arms: 10;
    energy: 100;
    freeArms: function( tasks ) {
        if (this.arms-tasks >= 0){
            this.arms = this.arms - 1;
