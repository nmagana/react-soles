# react-soles
Welcome to the React Tech @ SOLES course! Below you will find helpful links to help set up your environment and a tentative course schedule for the quarter!

# Environment Setup

## Visual Studio Code 

If you already have a source-code editor of preference, feel free to continue using it. If you don't have one, I recommend using Visual Studio Code. [Download here](https://code.visualstudio.com). 

## Node.js

Node.js will allow you to run JavaScript files. [Download here](https://nodejs.org/en/).

## cmder (Terminal Emulator for Windows)

Why not git bash

If you are running Windows, install cmder to avoid using Window's wack console) [Download here](http://cmder.net).

## Setting Up 

First, clone this repository into your local workspace. If you don't know how to do that, click the `clone or download` button on the top right of the page (or just copy the command below), then copy the link. I'd recommend setting up a dedicated github-projects directory. Once in this directory, input the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/nmagana/react-soles.git
```
